## Initializers

Initializer functions modify or initialize Objects; Be careful to not re-initialize Objects without releasing them before, or you'll cause memory leaks.

In practice, if available memory isn't an issue, it is often easier to initialize all the required Objects at the beginning of the program, and release them at the end.
